### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a conversion of [gitfire](url) to python: [gitfire-py](github.com/Vortigern-The-Grey/gitfire-py)  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to better configure [NVChad](nvchad.com)  
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on funny little cli programs (I only know python)
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with adding cli options to [gitfire-py](github.com/gitfire-py)  
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about how to setup NVChad on Windows p.s. you need [Scoop](scoop.sh) 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: If it's about my projects, open an issue! Otherwise, I hang out in the NVChad discord.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him

- âš¡ Fun fact: I spend more time making my software use [catppuccin](catppuccin.com) than using my software.
